IMPORTANT: please use Chrome to open the website, because the smoothly scroll effect doesn't work in Safari.
The landing-page.html is the home page. I implement two extra items: data collection and data visualization,
you can find them in navigation bar. Except two extra items, all the requested elements are in the same html page,
you could scroll or choose them in the nav bar. I made the resume in html. Thank you.
